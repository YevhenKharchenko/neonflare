        Look, we were just sick of games that felt like work, so we made
        something that's actually... nice?
      </p>
      <p class="about-text">
        You join Sara, a passionate gem hunter, and her adorable companion Puppy
        Snuffy on a journey through gorgeous worlds with hidden secrets and cool
        stuff to find. Each level invites you to slow down, match jewels, and
        enjoy the simple satisfaction of watching the board come alive. There’s
        no rush. No harsh difficulty spikes. Just puzzles that feel rewarding
        and comforting at the same time. It’s the kind of game you open “just
        for a minute” — and end up playing much longer.
